A Complete Machine Learning Walk-Through in Python: Part Three - Interpreting a machine learning model and presenting results [11 minutes]

https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/machine-learning-project-walkthrough/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Project%20Part%203.ipynb

This introductory Jupyter notebook will help you practice the final stage of the machine learning life-cycle, which is interpreting the model and presenting your results to others. Specifically, it practices feature importance, visualizing a single decision tree, and LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations).

After completing the programming code components, think about which methodologies you would employ in your project and how you would use them.
