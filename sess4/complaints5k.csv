I noticed the fraudulent withdrawals and contacted Chase Bank by the next day on XX/XX/2022 to alert them of this security issue, cancel my current card, have a new card issued, and dispute the ATM transactions. After 10 business days they have denied my claim despite my having physical possession of the card, and the withdrawals taking place XXXX miles away from where I live. 

I was surprised and disappointed that Chase denied this claim and could not get a satisfactory answer from their claims department as to why. Do they not have fraud prevention measures in place that protects me from excessive transactions being made within minutes of each other from another state and area from which I do not reside nor visit ( ever ). Additionally, is there no longer a daily limit for ATM cash withdrawals?

I am contacting this department to further pursue reimbursement of these funds in full ( {$1500.00} ). Under the circumstances, I do not think proper or just consideration has been observed by Chase Banks claims department with the denial of this claim. I appreciate any and all help in this matter.

However, recently when i checked my statement, i was shocked to discover that after paying about XXXX through the monthly payments, the outstanding amount was still {$6500.00}, almost equal to original financing amount.

I set up auto pay for the minimum monthly payment to be decided by Synchrony. The amount billed by Synchrony was paid through auto pay every single month on time. 
I was under the impression that Synchrony would recover the amount timely through monthly payments. Additionally, i set up the auto pay to ensure the monthly payments were processed on time. 
However, recently when i checked my statement, i was shocked to discover that after paying about XXXX through the monthly payments, the outstanding amount was still {$6500.00}, almost equal to original financing amount. 
Apparently, Synchrony charged me {$4300.00} in Interest for the first 24 months also on the ground that i still had a balance of {$2400.00} at the end of 24 months. 

This is totally unfair on the following grounds. 
XXXX ) I did not decide the monthly amount to be paid but the bank did. So, how come my minimum monthly payment amount was not set to ensure recovery of full amount in the first 24 months? Did bank set a lower monthly payment amount to ensure some balance does remain outstanding at the end of 24 months, giving them an excuse to charge a heavy penalty? 

XXXX ) Despite having my email and phone on the file, i was not informed by Synchrony that they are going to charge me {$4300.00} in penal interest if i don't settle the {$1800.00} balance at the end of XXXX. Their claim that they sent a monthly estatement isn't fair as they never sent a statement even through email, it was just an email notifying that the new statement is ready. 
In addition, as a responsible person, i opted for estatement ( caring for the environment ) and set up auto pay to ensure timely monthly payment. Therefore, i didn't really think of looking at the standard monthly email. 
If they had sent a letter, called me or even sent a separate email notifying me of such a huge charge, i would have immediately paid as i haven't delayed any single payment.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,OH,45040,,Consent provided,Web,2023-01-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6388094

After my father died my mother updated her trust and I and my husband created our own. I started the process of completing the forms for my mothers accounts in XXXX of XXXX and Mine in XXXX of XXXX.

The POD 's are still not completed on either one of my mother 's or my accounts. I have called approximately 25 times to have this process completed. I have uploaded forms through the online portal, via email requests for documents and I have been given multiple explanations as to why this is not complete. I think it is important to note that the calls take approximately one hour at a minimum ( which now delights me in knowing that other people are being treated poorly waiting ). Yesterday XXXX took about 75 minutes. Two weeks ago on XXXX the call was probably 90 minutes and the call on XXXX was over two hours. I have been escalated to member relations and supervisors. All of which takes an exorbitant amount of time for them to realize how many calls, documents, uploads, notes, and requests are in the system for a simple POD of a Trust to my mother 's accounts and a different POD of a trust to my accounts. I have a copy of EVERY SINGLE document that I have sent or resent, or changed or updated or whatever was asked of me to complete a simple POD.

2023-02-07,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/2020, I noticed that I had lost my credit card. I immediately reported it lost and requested a new credit card from Bank of America. I received e-mail notification that a new card would be mailed to me. I did not receive one, and Bank of America did not put a freeze on the account. 

On XX/XX/2020, after the XXXX holiday, I logged into my Bank of America account online. There were in store charges in excess of {$3000.00} made during the holiday week on the card. I promptly called to report the fraud, to understand why the account had not been frozen, and why I had never received a new card in the mail. They were very apologetic, froze the account, and issued a new credit card number. They also opened a fraud dispute and temporarily credited my account. 

After 30 days, I received a notice saying that my fraud claim was denied because I had made purchases at these vendors in the past. However, that is not true. Whoever had my card spent ~ {$2000.00} at XXXX XXXX, which I had not been to in recent memory. In addition, {$600.00} at XXXX, and my phone provider was XXXX at the time. I explained the facts again, and the fraud agent opened an appeal case. 

After 30 additional days, I received a second notice that the claim was denied for the same reason. I called once more, and explained the facts. I did not have the card in my possession, as I had reported it lost prior to any of these in store purchases. The fraud agent then instructed me to file a police report, which I had not been instructed to do until this time. 

I then filed a local police report, and submitted it to the fraud department. Some time later, I received yet another notice that the claim was denied for the same reason as the first two times. 

Ultimately, I ended up paying for the fraudulent charges because it would be too expensive to hire legal counsel. It is aggravating that a very reputable financial institution would handle a fraud claim in this manner. I have since transitioned my core banking to a local credit union, and will soon close all accounts held with Bank of America because of how this claim was handled two years ago. I was recently made aware that I could file a complaint with the CFPB so that at least my experience would be on the record.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",MI,48236,,Consent provided,Web,2023-02-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6541114

NOTICE OF PENDING LITIGATION SEEKING RELIEF AND MONETARY DAMAGES UNDER FCRA SECTION 616 & SECTION 617 Please accept this final written OFFER OF SETTLEMENT BEFORE LITIGATION as my attempt to amicably resolve your continued violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding your refusal to delete INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated information from my consumer file. I intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover all monetary damages that I may be entitled to under Section 616 and Section 617 if the INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated items listed below are not deleted immediately. A copy of this letter as well as INACCURATE ERRONEOUS ITEMS sent to you previously will also become part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used as evidence in pending litigation provided you fail to comply with this offer of settlement.

YOU ARE IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct. In the results of your investigations, you stated in writing that you verified that these items are being reported correctly? Who verified these accounts? You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Furthermore you have failed to provide the method of verification as required under Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown.

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated.. i recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes.

The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 1 ) the banking system is dependent upon my consumer report being fair, and accurate. After taking a look at my consumer report I realize that my report was an accurate, and this inaccurate report is unfair to me because I was never notified when this an accurate information was furnished, and I was never notified when during your companys initial investigation that you were going to report this information. 

Pursuing to 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 1 ) this grave error has undermined my confidence in your companies procedures, and as a result of this I will no longer be extending credit, and if this information is not removed I no longer want my information reported in your companys database. 

Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) - your company is a powerless elaborate mechanism. This must help that your company has caused has ruined my reputation, and it has adversely affect my credit worthiness.

Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 3 ) - your company assume this role you were not given Xpress permission by me, the consumer, or a competent court of jurisdiction. So, not only did you fail when the initial investigation of this information, you also assumed this role, and assumed this information was valid. Which is a violation of my consumer rights. 

Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) - you did not ensure that this information is accurate, and you did not exercise your boy responsibility with fairness and impartiality. You took one side of the story, and never consulted with me to find out if this transaction even took place. As a result of this my privacy was breached, and this violated my right to privacy. ( See Exhibit A ) Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( I ) - Congress makes it clear that a consumer report should NOT include transactions between the consumer and the person making the report. This alleged transaction that you are reporting, and failed to investigate, whether or not it factually took place, can be categorized as a transaction that took place between the consumer, and the person making the report. Which means it should not be included in my consumer report, and in fact is a VIOLATION of my comnsumer right. 

Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( III ) - In your initial investigation I was never given the opportunity to deny this information being communicated on my consumer report. This is in fact another violation.

Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681a ( B ) - any authorization of a specific extension of credit of a credit card or similar device should be excluded from my consumer report. Thats a legend transaction that your company clearly do not investigate is categorized as a transaction that was issued from a credit card. Credit card as defined under Title 15 USC 1602 ( I ) ( Definition attached and highlighted in Exhibit B ) Pursuant Title 15 USC 1681a ( e ) - The production of an "" investigative consumer report '' involves obtaining information about a consumer 's character, reputation, personal characteristics, or lifestyle through personal interviews with their neighbors, friends, associates, or others who may have knowledge of the consumer. This information is used to form a report that provides a comprehensive understanding of the consumer. 

In order to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted, it is important to gather as much information as possible from a variety of sources. This includes obtaining full names and addresses of all individuals interviewed, as well as a detailed account of what was said during the interviews. Additionally, it is important to confirm the method used to verify the information obtained during the interviews, as this helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information included in the report. 

It is also important to note that the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) regulates the production of consumer reports, including investigative consumer reports. The FCRA sets strict guidelines for the information that can be included in a consumer report, as well as the methods used to obtain that information. Under the FCRA, companies producing consumer reports are required to conduct a reasonable investigation and to provide consumers with a copy of the report if requested. They must also provide the consumer with information about the sources of the information included in the report. 

In conclusion, the production of an investigative consumer report requires a thorough investigation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information included in the report. The FCRA provides the legal framework for the production of consumer reports and helps to ensure that consumers are protected against the dissemination of inaccurate or incomplete information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",WA,98579,,Consent provided,Web,2023-02-04,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6523975

The week of this incident I contacted XXXX regarding releasing a key to my unit to my aunt so she could be escorted with law enforcement to grab my belongings from the unit, on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX and explained the situation she granted permission for my aunt to come. I then sent my aunt a text providing her contact and address ( see attachment of text screenshot ). My aunt did come on that day with law enforcement. At this time, I was already gone, and my boyfriend was there. 
The next following week or so I reached back out to XXXX to advise her I will not be returning to that unit, she then advised me on the phone that she will process everything and reach back out to me with any fees that will be owed but insured me all fees including the lease termination fee will be waived. 
She did not reach out back out until XXXX to inform me of minor fees and a missing washer and dryer ( which later was discovered we brought our own dryer and washer ) and informed me she was waiting on the invoice for the paint job for the dining room wall and she will contact me when she has the information which never happened. 
On or around late XXXX I received a call from a collection company for a balance of {$2600.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, my boyfriend XXXX was in XXXX for business and he stopped by XXXX to address this matter. He sat down with XXXX, XXXX stated XXXX can not waive any fees or etc. because she does not have the authority too, XXXX was not at work this day. XXXX questioned the fees, etc. because it was all wrong and was not the correct amount. XXXX stated she will speak with XXXX and reach back out to us, which never happened, he contacted her almost XXXX weeks later I believe. 
All incoming calls are recorded so it was extremely easy for XXXX to pull the call me and XXXX had regarding this however she did not. This reporting is inaccurate information which is a ground for deletion and non-pay since this is hereby a violation per FCRA. I have no issue in doing so but I have other things I can be doing besides an issue that is so easy to solve and this should have never reached this point if job duties were conducted.

XXXX ) I moved out XX/XX/XXXX. I would like this corrected and prorate corrected. 
XXXX ) Utilities prorated amount is incorrect XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Notice fee is not removed It was made clear to XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX this balance is no issue ; however, the issue is the balance is not correct. I sent the police report and the protection order as well. Once XXXX discovered that this was an issue then she could have called the collection company to place this account on hold until she reviewed everything so it would not hit my credit reports for an error that should have never taken place and/or had the collection account sent back to XXXX. 
All I am requesting which is all I have been saying since all this started is the amount correct so it can be paid, now it has hit my credit file so I am requesting this account be pull out of collection, removed from my credit file, and sent back to XXXX for adjustment so I can make a payment and be done with this issue, So, it is removed from my credit file. Paying whatever is owed is not the concern at all. 
I have attached several emails, GA power disconnect notice request, screenshot of me asking my aunt to get the key, U-Haul pickup, etc. to verify such dates and information. 

All I am requesting is this is corrected so I can pay when it's done but most importantly, removed from my credit file. 

I never recieved any nofications from XXXX XXXX XXXX at all to dispute this information. It was placed on my credit file with a balance of XXXX, months later they updated the balance to XXXX in which I do not know why.

There were numerous times over the last few years that I had to contact Wells Fargo regarding my account due to Overdraft Fees that I didn't feel were justified. I noticed and addressed with various bankers that a large amount of small payments would stay "" pending '' for longer than usual, then they would allow a large payment ( rent ) to go through before a deposit. This would tank my account, then they would allow my deposit to bring it back up, then they would process all the small amounts at once and charge me overdraft fees for each. I have called each time and while they never fully refunded the fees, they would say "" we can reimburse you a percentage '' and that percentage would change each time I spoke with them. Sometimes, they would claim I had met my limit on getting fees overturned and would deny my request.

I am unsure how to submit a request to be a part of this settlement, but I do believe that I qualify. I do believe that Wells Fargo continuously took money from me in fees, unnecessarily.

All legal notices 2. Proof of the commercially reasonable manner of the notification 3. Verified resale of the subject vehicle vin # # XXXX However- no valid proof was ever given to me just incoherent information. It was noted that all parties had 15 days from receipt of their certified mail notice. Yet, the response from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paperwork received on XX/XX/XXXX, is null and invalid. The reporting from XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is an invalid claim and will be considered a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. If this matter is not solved properly throughout CFPB I will seek further damages against all parties under federal and state laws involved in this matter for not taking appropriate actions. '' As I submitted this CFPB complaint, I had expected accurate and legitimate information to be submitted. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I got a response from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' that did not meet the required information as stated UCC Article XXXX ( stated above ) nor has XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX respond to the CFPB complaint. 

Most importantly, XXXX XXXX XXXX '' response indicated that "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' is servicing the loan for "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' whereas I am requesting a contract where "" I '' signed that I allowed "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' to have my personal information. Per the contract, that I have acknowledged shows that I only did business with "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' alone. As I did not allow a third party nor was given certified mail ( proper ) notice ( wet signature requirement ) of a release of information to a third party. For that reason, this process is a violation of my privacy under CCPA and California law, Civil Code Section 1798.99.80, which defines a data broker as a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship. I will be submitting a complaint to the Office of the Attorney General. If I am not given proper information as stated above in the initial CFPB. 

Additionally, "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' added other documents to the CFPB complaint of XX/XX/XXXX such as "" Payment History '' which is showing opening bal : XXXX and a log of amount mode ( payments ) and balance amt that have equaled down to zero. Please note, I am required to have : A check/ deposit copy ( from the private buyer to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX for the amount of {$19000.00} ), a bill of sale ( from XXXX ), paperwork copy ( from XXXX for the amount of {$26000.00} ), and lastly copy of check/deposit and where the warranty refund got directed to ( from XXXX for the amount of {$1300.00} ). None of this information being reported was ever given to me, which is not following UCC 9-506. - EFFECT OF ERRORS OR OMISSIONS, 9-611. - NOTIFICATION BEFORE DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL, 9-612. - TIMELINESS OF NOTIFICATION BEFORE DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL, and 9-613. - CONTENTS AND FORM OF NOTIFICATION BEFORE DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX my credit report on Experian is reporting account name XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX as closed with an amount of {$12000.00}, and active reporting per each month. However, the information stated above including the missing information shows that this misreporting is unlawful, null, and is a violation of FCRA whereas should be removed from my credit report. 

If no such proof is provided from 1 to 3 ( stated above ) within 15 days from receipt of this certified mail notice, the alleged claim of a deficiency will be considered null and void, and any continued collection activities, or continued reporting of this invalid claim on my credit reports will be considered a violation of the FDCPA and FCRA. 

In addition, if you singularly or severally fail to fulfill with the above requests, I reserve the rights to seek damages against all parties, under all available State and Federal statutes and including but not limited to UCC 9-625 remedies. All documentation will be filed through FCRA protocol to provide proof of the above stated 1 to 3 obligation.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CA,92544,,Consent provided,Web,2023-01-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6437827

2023-01-10,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Im honestly stumped. Regardless of how many times I claim to be the individual writing this letter it seems this message is truly missed. For the record, Im the one whos initiating these disputes under my name. The following items are UNKNOWN to ME. I dont get why youre claiming these are fraudulent or of a high risk nature. The documents Ive provided are legit. These are mine, filed with the appropriate agencies & support my position. Lets get the record straight!!! First of all I know that under Section 619 Obtaining information under false pretenses that any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18 United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. Most importantly, Ive never sent my documentation to anyone else which seems to be a claim that constitutes high-risk due to potential fraud. According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) Determination That Dispute IsFrivolous or irrelevant ( A ) a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information. ( B ) Notice of determination. Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph ( A ) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. Again, under 617 Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [ 15U.S.C. 1681o ] a person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( 2 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

I found that under section 605b ( a ) Equifax and XXXX shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt and it requires the following documents and statement to remove the disputed accounts on my file : ( 1 ) Appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) A copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) The identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) A statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer.

The dispute items do not belong to me. Im attaching the required FTC Report for you ( which complies with FCRA Section 603 ( q ) ( 4 ) which states ( 4 ) The term "" identity theft report '' has the meaning given that term by rule of the Bureau, and means, at a minimum, a report ( A ) That alleges an identity theft ; ) ( B ) That is a copy of an official, valid report filed by a consumer with an appropriate Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency, including the United States Postal Inspection Service, or such other government agency deemed appropriate by the Bureau ; and ( C ) The filing of which subjects the person filing the report to criminal penalties relating to the filing of false information if, in fact, the information in the report is false. ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

If you feel there is a possibility these accounts belong to me I will require all documentation that bears my signature ( another research item I found that requires you to verify with 100 % accuracy that each account is 100 % true, accurate, correct, complete & VERIFIABLE ). If you do not provide any records & claim the item is verified please understand I will seek legal action. I do not take kindly to games nor does my attorney.

I paid the outstanding amount due to keep my account current, and was informed the next payment would be deducted from the account we setup for the ongoing payments. Today, upon getting an email indicating my payment was never made, and receiving a {$29.00} late fee, I attempted to call BOA. I called numerous phone numbers with BOA and in each case, the automated response said they would not be answering calls at this time. I went to their twitter account, and there was no official update about the website, or any services being down. When trying to use the website, I can not update the payment profile for my account. 

I was given information by a representative that resulted in a {$29.00} fee, account suspended, credit hit, website doesnt work, and customer service wont answer any of the calls.

2023-01-09,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","I have had a mortgage since XXXX. The loan has been handled by multiple servicers due to the discretion of mortgage companies to sell the loan at their discretion. Since the purchase of my home, the loan has been serviced by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX AmeriHome Mortgage and most recently XXXX XXXX 

While I was being serviced by AmeriHome, I made mostly online payments. The XX/XX/XXXX online payment seemed to have an error in processing ( payment was made XXXX ) that I was not made aware of until the XXXX billing statement was received. Upon learning that the XXXX payment didn't process, I immediately processed the payment online AND paid the XX/XX/XXXX payment. There was no issue with lack of funds. I submitted an online payment request in XXXX and moved on as I have done for several months. 

I learned in late XXXX that AmeriHome reported to XXXX a late payment on the mortgage ( the only XXXX since XXXX ). Subsequently, that XXXX late payment due to a technical issue with the AmeriHome online payment platform and NOT an inability to pay caused me to experience a XXXX XXXX XXXX in my XXXX XXXX, reducing my score from XXXX down to XXXX. I have contacted AmeriHome via telephone on numerous occasions in XXXX without success. I was notified in late XX/XX/XXXX that my loan was being sold to XXXX XXXX 

I feel like this action of AmerHome to drastically reduce my XXXX XXXX based on XXXX late payment and then sell the loan to another company XXXX day later was predatory and has cause me undue harm in my financial profile. A XXXX point decrease in my XXXX XXXX dropped me from the "" very good '' to "" fair '' tier with XXXX action. 

This situation does not accurately reflect my payment history, my credit management history and has placed me in a position of being perceived to be a credit risk unnecessarily. 

I am also extremely disappointed with AmeriHome 's unwillingness to even address this issue with me as a customer. I feel as though I experienced undue harm to my financial reputation due to no fault of my own and have had XXXX XXXX of recourse with AmeriHome.",,"AmeriHome Mortgage Company, LLC",CA,91107,,Consent provided,Web,2023-01-09,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6415065

2022-11-20,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I bank with Bank of America ; primary branch this involves is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CO XXXX. My issue is not with the associates at this branch, but more so with the general business practices of Bank of America in general. 

For context, I have never been in trouble with the law aside from so much as a speeding ticket nor have I ever been involved in any nefarious financial practices. I've been banking with these people for well over a year ; I've never over-drafted my account. My employer albeit a new employer is a major health system in XXXX, CO. In banking with multiple banks for over 10 years, I have never had a bank be as unprofessional or put me in such a dire situation that threatened my ability to pay my bills in a timely manner as Bank of America. Finally, as a consumer I have every right to know if there is a concern regarding my bank account. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/2022 I went to the BOA branch listed above to deposit a paycheck for the amount of {$2900.00}. I have been having issues with this bank for several pay periods now in regards to having access to my funds in a timely manner so I asked the teller at this time, if there was any issues with my check or if he sees any possible reason for a deposit hold to occur- he replied no. He also mistyped my amount into the BOA system as {$2200.00} which I discovered later that day. I have no issues with the teller as he is human and these things happen. 

However, on Monday XX/XX/2022 I went to resolve the discrepancy and the branch said that their back office caught the mistake and they fixed it. However, now there was deposit hold on my funds and I would have access to my funds on XX/XX/2022. That is 8 business days. If I had to pay rent, student loans etc. or had an emergent situation arise, I would be in an incredibly difficult situation that would have threatened my livelihood. I work very hard to pay my bills on time and keep my credit score up. Still, I understand that these things happen. 

What I can not comprehend however, is their lack of communication about why this deposit hold occurred in the first place or their inability to resolve the hold in a timely manner. Per general Federal Reserve regulations and preliminary research I have conducted, from my understanding, the general maximum a bank is allowed to hold your funds is 7 business days ( unless there is a holiday, which there was not ), unless you meet certain criteria such as : ( 1 ) you've over drafted your account multiple times, ( 2 ) your account is brand new, ( 3 ) you may have taken place in some nefarious financial practices or the check looks illegitimate, or ( 4 ) your employer has a lack of funds in their account. As explained above, I meet none of these criteria. 

Their excuse was, it could be that your employer does not have enough funds in their account ( their bank is XXXX XXXX, for reference ). That excuse does not hold as : ( 1 ) none of my colleagues have had any issue with their banks, and ( 2 ) they have BEEN doing this to me for multiple pay periods when I had a different employer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Now I have to ask, what are the chances that both of my employers have insufficient funds in their respective accounts- or could it be that you, Bank of America, the common denominator, is the problem here? 

Moreover, if they even gave me a reasonable explanation such as they are short-staffed so processing of holds is taking longer, I would have dropped it. Instead, when I called customer service on Thursday, XX/XX/2022, they basically said "" you're out of luck, we reserve the right to hold your funds without giving you, the consumer, an explanation as to why we are holding your funds. '' I'm sorry, but that is simply unacceptable and even though there is probably no explicit law or regulation they may be breaking, this is infringing on a grey area that can absolutely threaten everyday Americans ' livelihoods which is why I am filing this complaint. Furthermore, I tried to resolve this with Bank of America in numerous ways to no avail : ( 1 ) Before even taking it to a physical branch location on XX/XX/2022, I thought of trying to deposit the check on their mobile app by taking a picture. However, historically, Bank of America has tried to charge me roughly a {$200.00} fee to process it this way, an unfair banking practice in it of itself ( 2 ) I asked for my paycheck back so I can take it to XXXX XXXX, to which they replied, no, they have no way to canceling out the transaction and returning my paper check, which I have a very hard time believing as this is a major financial institution of the United States of America ( 3 ) I escalated this issue x2 with upper management via the local branch listed above and upper management could not ( 1 ) give me a reasonable ETA on when this situation would be resolved, and ( 2 ) would not disclose any information to me, the consumer, on why the hold occurred in the first place- which is the true reason behind this complaint. 

Finally, aside from the laughable fact that it takes a major financial institution such as BOA, with the resources that they have accessible to them, 8 business days to resolve what I perceive to be an everyday hold - when I opened an account with Bank of America, they never disclosed to me, verbally or otherwise, that they engaged in such practices of non-transparency or ridiculous hidden fees for mobile deposits. To my knowledge, I never signed paperwork stating as such either.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CO,80023,,Consent provided,Web,2022-11-20,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6225151

I called over a week ago when I noticed that movers I used charged me 3 times for a move I did on XX/XX/22. I reached out to the moving company and they did not respond to me. The card company did not flag them as fraud so I didn't realize the charges were made until I logged in to change my address and noticed the balance was higher than typical. I believe this date was XX/XX/22 but possibly sooner than that. I called and made a dispute, but the agent only disputed one of the two charges that were in question. 

I called back XX/XX/22 when I noticed that I only got one provisional credit after logging in to check on the status ( I assumed I would have gotten an email or message on the portal about the case but saw nothing ), then was told that they needed more information and that they were not going to issue a provisional credit because I didn't have proof that I didn't agree to the transaction. The agent then transferred me to an onshore rep who was unable to add the second transaction so I asked for a manager call back. 

I got a call back on Friday from a manager. She did not bother to check the reason I asked for the callback and stated, "" I dont know why you asked for a call back '' and then transferred me back to the dispute department who was still unable to dispute a transaction but was able to submit a manager callback. I then called back to make a complaint and that agent was finally able to dispute both charges. 

Today, I got a callback from a second manager. This manager was able to confirm that they sent information to the wrong address despite having my correct address on file and they also confirmed that allegedly someone called me on XX/XX/22 but they did not leave a voicemail, I also don't have any missed call from any unknown number on this date, so I questioned if they ever called me. 

I asked if she could either email me or mail me the information that they need in writing, she refused to do so and said that if I didn't understand her verbal instructions ( she was not consistent in her instructions and would frequently refuse to answer questions directly ) that I risked the investigation being closed. 

I have NEVER had to jump through so many hoops with other banks to dispute a transaction. I have never had a company refuse to provide instructions in writing to support an investigation. I feel like they were more focused on trying to paint me out as a escalated caller, at one point I stated "" be XXXX for real '' in response to one of her many snide comments and she used that as a tool to try to end the call for the duration. It took 40 minutes of her trying to dismiss my questions for her to finally calm down and just answer things directly. She even went as far as stating on the call that I recorded that the reason why she wont answer the questions I was asking for 40 minutes that she would not answer is because she believed that I "" would not like the response '' Yet, when she finally answered them, I was able to have a clear understanding of the process. 

The merchant has not returned the money, and I as of this moment do not have a clear understanding of what is needed to finish the investigation because the credit card company has now stated that they refuse to provide me anything in writing explaining the process because they have allegedly called me to give that information although I have no record of a call and they acknowledged they never sent a letter or voicemail, etc.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,BARCLAYS BANK DELAWARE,MD,20815,,Consent provided,Web,2022-11-26,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6242878

2023-01-05,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","I refinanced from original XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX. From XXXX XXXX  to The XXXX XXXX Bank, the fixed interest rate went from XXXX to XXXX. I am also enrolled in XXXX with XXXX XXXX, so I dont pay property taxes due to be a 100  Percent Permanent and Total Veteran. It was a XXXX  XXXX as well. I was informed by The XXXX XXXX Bank that my account will be transferred to another company PHH Mortgage, for no apparent reason, but because the computer does this without their control XXXX of XXXX. I made every payment on time and numerous times it was made early. 
PHH Mortgage could not find my account for whole month of XXXX, although The XXXX XXXX Bank said my next payment XXXX of XXXX has to be with PHH Mortgage. Therefore, The XXXX XXXX Bank accepted XXXX more payment. I called PHH Mortgage several times concerned about this, and paying on time as usual. 
I was able to see my account mid XX/XX/XXXX with PHH Mortgage and they had extremely high figures as if the loan was just established, they set it in my profile at the original price of the home in XXXX of XXXX which was {$280000.00} When I addressed this, they informed me that all payments went to principal. I advised this was incorrect. I also questioned why wasnt the amounts just transferred because there was no figuring needing to be done. 
I called back XXXX of XXXX because it showed my mortgage payment increasing XXXX of XXXX by {$26.00} PHH Mortgage said my insurance went up an I was now in the whole {$680.00} XXXX immediately called my insurance XXXX XXXX an they have me assigned to XXXX XXXX handling my account. Therefore XXXX XXXX advised that it should not be in the whole {$680.00} but it infact went up. They confirmed all amounts in XXXX the insurance was {$1100.00} in XXXX the insurance was {$1400.00} an the difference was {$340.00} At that moment we made a few adjustments to bring it down and PHH Mortgage was sent the new Declaration document showing the new amount XXXX XXXX PHH Mortgage received the document. Once I questioned PHH Mortgage where the {$680.00} in the whole came from, they now advised XXXX XXXX that its property taxes as well. I advised that I dont pay property taxes, a questioned if they infact received all documents from The XXXX XXXX Bank . I was extremely terrified because my next payment in XX/XX/XXXX was even higher, approximately {$20.00} more and increasing. I demanded answers and requested new analysis, proper paperwork and what were they truly charging for interest then. 
XXXX the escalation XXXX finally took over the case and advised that they will contact the XXXX tax office to confirm my XXXX. But they would only do this first, then they will address the overpayment from inputting my insurance and mortgage payments. This was unacceptable to me, due to being impacted by increasing payments I do not owe because of their negligence. 
I am not sure what figured they have regarding my insurance, my interest rate, nor the correct amount owed left on my XXXX  XXXX. I am not sure what they have regarding the correct mortgage payment. I am not getting much assistance and this is an enormous investment, however, it is not being handled as such.

2023-02-01,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","To whom it may concern, The story is very long and complicated and we have already written before about our situation hoping that all would be resolved. 
In brief we received a COVID exemption on our mortgage during the COVID pandemic. We were given three different COVID relief packages and gratefully took them. Wells Fargo said we would add the back mortgage payments to the final payment at the end of our tenure as owners of the house. 
When the covid relief ended we requested a loan modification and were approved. We sent in the documentation requested, the final signatures and were told that they were being upgraded to the system and all was fine. After a strangely long time and our attempt to contact someone with knowledge at Wells Fargo without any success, we decided to just go ahead and pay our old mortgage payment and proceed until someone contacted Us. 
Much to our surprise, we were unable to pay the mortgage and wells said we had gone into foreclosure. 
Letters had been mailed but not received and we were totally dumbfounded. This was not only consistent with the covid relief statements but it was also double tracking as we were in the process of an approved loan modification. 
Again we spoke with great difficulty to someone at wells fargo and were told that a mistake had been made that the foreclosure was not happening to proceed with our loan modification and make mortgage payments. We promptly made a mortgage payment which was accepted and eagerly awaited news about the second time asking for the loan modification. 
Now we have received in the system a note that we have thirty days to do a shortsale. 
This is illegal but the stress and anxiety that it is causing me and my wife and daughters is extreme. 
This is not honest, professional or legal and we need help.

Take action immediately you are in violation. 

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated.. i recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes.

I have never conducted business with them. I am not liable for this debt with them and I do not have a contract with them at all. They did not even provide me with the original application like I requested several times ( 5 ) now. I did not give them written permission either to report this to any credit bureau or add to my credit report. All I ever received was a generic email stating that this account has been verified and I asked how? No response ever given due to it being a generic email that they send to all their customers. I even called on yesterday to get this item removed and was told it could not be removed after being on the phone with them for almost 3 hours trying to reach a real person. I was transferred to almost every department in the company instead of the right one I requested, which was the fraud department.

Take action immediately you are in violation. 

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 

1.The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2. What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3. My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that is incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ). 
I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable and Invalidated.. i recently applied for extended credit and was denied i am in distress because of your mistakes.

However, we were initially excited to learn that our delivery date had been moved up to mid XX/XX/XXXX. While we were excited, we needed to figure what to do with our currently leased vehicle which was not due back until XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, as we saw in the news, Tesla was looking to complete sales by year end we were offered an "" incentive '' to take delivery before the end of the year. The "" incentive '' was {$3700.00} ( which went up to {$7000.00} a week after we took delivery of our car ). With that being said we were somewhat disappointed we were not offered the {$7000.00} "" incentive. '' Fast forward to Friday XX/XX/XXXX, and we come to learn that our vehicle 's price had now dropped from {$64000.00} to {$55000.00} ( plus tax ) nationally. Since then I have made two phone calls to Tesla to express my frustration and feelings of being defrauded by the company. The 2nd phone call I waited 2.5 hours on hold just to speak to a representative. Both representatives ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - In-Bound Team XXXX Region ) explained that there is nothing that they can do and they understand my frustration. Nonetheless, I feel as if this "" incentive '' scam was an effort to milk as much money out of customers before the prices would change in less than 30 days. Even more frustrating, after a review of my paperwork, I could have delayed picking up the vehicle for 30 days without penalty ; and since my delivery date was XX/XX/XXXX, I could have delayed picking up my vehicle and fallen under the new pricing. 

While I do understand that prices change, this effort to "" incentivize '' customers to take an early delivery of their car so they could make more money from my family, feels like a complete scam. When I asked how this creates any type of brand loyalty, both representatives were unable to answer my question with any honest sincerity.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Telsa Motors Inc,NY,11758,,Consent provided,Web,2023-01-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6447041

I filled out a hardship application in XXXXXXXX XXXX but was declined as I was on unemployment for my only income and Key Bank stated that they could not use unemployment income. I then gained full time employment in XX/XX/2022. I re-applied for a hardship, and again was declined due to XXXX.

I was told that they could not give me that information because they had sent it to a foreclosure attorney already. 

My 2 biggest issues is that I was not given the option to pay it in full at the time it was expressed to me that my hardship application was declined, and secondly, it was sent to a foreclosure attorney before I was even given the opportunity to appeal it. This is true for both the dates and also I had not received the appeal paperwork before it was sent to the foreclosure attorney. 

I believe these motions were not necessary and unfair.

That check was intercepted in the mail and signed over to a "" XXXX XXXX '' which was not approved, ( nor do we know this person ) by XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was also altered to read "" {$9500.00}. '' You can clearly see in the copy I have attached below that the one was altered to a XXXX both numerically and in the written portion of the check. It was then successfully cashed at a Bank of America, which we are stunned about, considering the check looks clearly altered. I went ahead and notified XXXX immediately when I noticed it was cashed on XXXX, along with notifying my vendor that the check was originally was supposed to go to. He filed a police report ( information attached ) along with myself. I filed a police report with XXXX, IL XXXX which is where our warehouse is located. I also filed a claim with USPS. As soon as all the paperwork was filed, I received a call from a gentleman at Bank of America basically asking me questions about this case and he went ahead and said "" I can clearly see this is fraud so I will be marking it as a clear fraud case and it will be moved over to a different department that handles the re collecting of the money and giving it back to you. '' I have called Bank of America to see what the status was of our refund, and I have yet to hear anything. I am in constant contact with my bank ( XXXX ) but they said there is nothing that they can do and that they are at the mercy of Bank of America since that was where the check was cashed. I keep trying to call Bank of America and they say they can't help me because I don't bank with them. I offered the case number that XXXX provided me with and they said that their case number would be different from XXXX. I called XXXX again to see if they had any other case number and they don't. It has been a constant unfair battle. I am in constant contact with my banker and he is telling me there is nothing they can do until Bank of America responds. He also told me that Bank of America is now ignoring the emails that my banker and his supervisor are sending from XXXX. So now, not only am I being ignored from Bank of America, but so are the emails that are coming from XXXX Bank. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. We are talking about our hard earned money and Bank of America does not have the respect to respond after their bank allowed a fraudulent check to be cashed. I have provided all of the documentation supporting my case and I am really hoping that someone from the CFPB can help.

I have also contacted the police department for an update yesterday and the detective on the case has advised me that he believes he has located the individual that cashed this fraudulent check. He is in the works of getting a warrant.

15 U.S.C 1681c. ( a ) ( 5 ) states : no consumer reporting agency may make any consumer report containing any of the following items of information : Any other adverse item of information, other than the records of convictions of crimes which antedates the report by more than seven years.

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) states a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

The reporting of these accounts is a violation as I have not given written consent to furnish, my privacy has been violated and I have reason to believe the data reported is inaccurate since they do not match across any consumer reporting agency. DELETE THESE ACCOUNTS FROM MY CONSUMER REPORT. 
Please send me an updated report upon completion of my request.

2022-12-01,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Re : Defamation Of Character To whom it may concern, This is about the consumer report received via mail on XX/XX/2022. While going through the same, I came to know about a few inaccuracies and fraudulent information that you continue to furnish in my consumer report. 

According to 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act which states an elaborate mechanism must be developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, the credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.

Your company Transunion falsely reported information that resulted in defamation of my character. Furthermore, your company created deceptive forms that made creditors and employers believe that these were valid debts and I owed these alleged debts and was not able to pay, though you could not prove its validity. 

As a result, I was discriminated against and denied my right to extend credit. I suffered emotionally as well as from financial hardship. 
Your company is liable according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681o. 
I communicated with your company to dispute this information on XX/XX/2022. After your reinvestigation your company stated your results were verified as accurate however you have a duty to investigate anything immediately that is reported to you to determine if the reported information is inaccurate. 

No such investigation was conducted by your company ever. Your company never communicated with me to validate and verify that if this information that was reported to you that you furnished on my consumer report was accurate. I would like you to provide proof. And cause you did not do this it is impossible that your reinvestigation could provide your findings as reported as accurate as you stated on my consumer report. 

Furthermore you violated my rights to consent and privacy when you conducted that investigation and this information was first reported to you and you did not contact me to determine if this reported information of alleged debts owed was accurate, your company Transunion did not communicate with me to know if I consented to any of these transactions or this report. 

This is a violation of 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act which states There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with FAIRNESS, IMPARTIALITY and RESPECT for a consumers RIGHT to PRIVACY. 

Transunion as a consumer reporting agency and financial institution as per 15 USC 6827 ( 4 ) ( A ) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which states In general the term financial institution any business engaged in the business of providing financial services to customers who maintain a credit, deposit, trust or other financial accounts or relationship with the institution. 

You are in violation of 15 USC 94 ( a ) ( 1 ) your company made false and fictitious statements to obtain my vital information without my consent and privacy, also provided my information to third partys for pre qualification offers and soft inquiries companies such as XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  or XXXX XXXX  none of which I have ever extended my credit to or was ever involved in a consumer credit transaction with nor gave consent to have access to my non public private information. 

Your company is also in violation of 15 USC 94 ( a ) ( 2 ) no consumer credit transaction that includes my vital non public information shall not be reported on my consumer report. Your company furnished consumer credit transactions with my non public private information on my consumer report. 

Your company has not only infringed my right to consent and privacy also violated multiple federal laws.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NY,11234,,Consent provided,Web,2022-12-01,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6259088

I have met all of the conditions of receiving that bonus and have yet to receive it. 

At the time the account was opened, I was sold a "" pre-approved '' credit card by Regions. However, I was not told on that day or for most of the following week how much I was "" pre-approved '' or approved for. 

Ultimately, I was approved for a small fraction of the amount that other lenders have approved me for. Had I known this ; I would never have allowed a hard credit inquiry on my report nor would I have accepted Regions "" pre-approved '' credit card offer. 

On top of that, it took over four weeks to finally receive the credit card. 

Shortly after that, I spotted numerous unauthorized transactions on the account. I contacted the merchant and was advised to contact Regions. After wasting an hour on a chat with a Regions representative, largely because she could not verify my address due to her lack of understanding the XXXX XXXX XXXX in Regions system is an abbreviation for the word XXXX XXXX, '' a dispute was finally entered. 

However, I was not asked for any of the written communication sent to and received from the merchant. Nor was I provided with any written communication from Regions. 

Worse, yet, Regions has refused to provide provisional credits for the unauthorized amounts charged and in today 's chat I asked a different Regions representative if I was expected to pay for these unauthorized charges and her response was "" Correct. Of course, this is wholly unacceptable. 

Outside of meeting with a charming teller at Regions when I opened my checking account, dealing with Regions has been a nightmare. 

Not only do I have no faith in receiving a replacement card in a timely manner as the original card took a month to arrive, I have no faith that my credit card will be credited for the unauthorized transactions or that my checking bonus will be credited to my account in a timely fashion.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,34787,,Consent provided,Web,2023-01-12,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6433257

A total of {$190000.00} was "" wash '' or "" contra '' traded against another/other Coinbase account to drain my account. Wash trading is illegal, Coinbase allowed it to happen. 

This the {$190000.00} ( nearly {$200000.00} ) represents my life savings. Money saved over 20 years of sacrifices and savings. 

To execute this attack the attacker needs to have an account ( s ) on Coinbase to wash trade against my account, by forcing my account to Buy High and Sell low against trades to the attackers accounts, there by draining my account. 

This high frequency wash trading generated {$18000.00} in Trading Fee for Coinbase.

They fixed ONE account, so I followed up in XXXX of XXXX, Again NOTHING was done, so I submitted a complaint through cfpb - and the response I got was absolutely NOT what I asked them to investigate in my complaint. I made it very clear that ELEVEN of these accounts are XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX  ( student Loans ) and not to mention they are ALL CLOSED AND PAID IN FULL. Now their response says "" they verified with the furnisher and they responded that the information is reporting accurately '' NOT ONLY IS THIS FALSE INFORMATION- EVEN IF THEY DID VERIFY WITH THE FURNISHER - IT IS REPORTING INACCURATELY. 

A PAYMENT STATUS IS SUPPOSED TO REPORT AS THE CURRENT PAYMENT STATUS. 

How do you report a payment status saying "" paid was past due 120 days '' when there is no reported two year history, and it obviously shows closed and paid in full? This is an FCRA VIOLATION- it is outdate- incomplete- inaccurate - what ever word you want to use, but it is wrong and harming my credit score. - These are for the XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts there are 5 of these. 

The XXXX accounts- there are XXXX of these- are all over XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are reporting payment status as "" Paid was past due 120 days '' as well as a two year history from XXXXalso per FCRA guidelines you are not to report a history older than XXXX XXXX XXXX. And they were all 6 paid in full and closed. So the payment status is WRONG and the two year history needs to be removed. 

The last account is kashable- again this account is current and has been current- they are reporting a derogatory payment status of "" current, was past due 30 days two or more times '' which this again is WRONG and outdated. the thirty day late they are reporting XXXX of XXXX is INACCURATE they are the only bureau reporting that late payment and I was not late. 

So this being the FOURTH time I have asked EXPERIAN TO ACTUALLY READ THE COMPLAINT AND CORRECT THE INFORMATION THEY ARE REPORTING INACCURATELY, NOT THE FURNISHER, IF THIS IS NOT CORRECTED ON ALL TWELVE OF THESE ACCOUNTS I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO FILE A LAWSUIT DUE TO THE BLATANT DISREGARD FOR LAW AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 6 MONTHS!!!

The following items are UNKNOWN to ME. I dont get why youre claiming these are fraudulent or of a high risk nature. The documents Ive provided are legit. These are mine, filed with the appropriate agencies & support my position. Lets get the record straight!!! First of all I know that under FCRA Section 619 Obtaining information under false pretenses that any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18 United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. Most importantly, Ive never sent my documentation to anyone else which seems to be claim constitutes high-risk due to potential fraud. According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) Determination That Dispute Is Frivolous or Irrelevant ( A ) a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information. 

( B ) Notice of determination. Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph ( A ) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency.

Again, under 617 Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681o ] Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( 2 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

2023-02-02,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","So back in XXXX of 2022 we were coming out of forbearance. Upon getting everything ready to restart payments we were offered 2 options. Option 1 was an increase in our interest rate ( 6 % ) and our payments would move up {$300.00}. The second option was to keep our interest rate the same ( 2.25 % ) and resume our normal payments which were {$300.00} lower. I declined option 1 because it didn't make sense to choose over the second option. The Representative at Freedom Mortgage let me know option 1 was declined and that they would be rushing option 2 's paperwork out to us. Once we received the paperwork, we contacted a mobile notary and had the paperwork signed. About a week later I received a second packet in the mail. I called Freedom Morgage right away to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. The representative assured me that the 2nd packet that was sent to me was the same packet as the first one and assured me of the agreed interest rate and payment. Come XXXX I went to log into my account to pay my mortgage and noticed I was a month behind, and my interest rate was at 6 %. Freedom Mortgage told me that a mistake had occurred on their end by sending me the wrong paperwork and they would escalate the situation. I continued to check up on this for around 4-5weeks. Eventually a manager told me to fill out the old 2.25 interest rate paperwork and they would try and have underwriting adjust the start date ( since it had passed ) Underwriting then told them they can't do that and that they would need to send me new paperwork out. So, they went to re-do the paperwork, a few weeks later, they called me to tell me I was approved again, for a 6 % interest rate. We are now back in escalations with Freedom Mortgage and have been told its going to be very hard to turn around.

On XX/XX/XXXX, Transunion response ( SEE TransUnions Direct Response attached ) was ; we took one or more of the following action ( s ) : 1. Determined that the data furnisher had previously verified the reported information, 2. Asked the data furnisher reporting the information you disputed to do all of the following : Review relevant information we sent them, including any provided documents.

TransUnion has yet to provide evidence of a fair investigation according to 15 USC 1681 section 603 ( 3 ) ( E ) which states ; The term investigative consumer report means a consumer report or portion thereof in which information on a consumers character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living is obtained through personal interviews with neighbors, friends, or associates of the consumer reported on or with others with whom he is acquainted or who may have knowledge concerning any such items of information. However, such information shall not include specific factual information on a consumers credit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from the consumer.

This is yet again another violation of my rights including : 15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A, which states I have the right to privacy, 15 U.S.C 1681 Section 604 A Section 2, which states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions. Also, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.

I was also told if I was approved that they would match whatever had had in my savings account and add that to my secured credit card, so with that in mind I decided to put an additional XXXX on to my credit card to increase the amount to XXXX on XXXX XXXX I was approve for the increase and there was no issues. I noticed about a month later that my savings account was in the negative of {$2900.00} but me not having experienced with credit cards I assumed that it was an error on the bank end and went on with my life. Navy Federal never contacted me, Never sent an overdraft letter in regards to my account being overdraft. I didn't take the negative amount seriously until I called in asking information on how I can increase my chances of getting approve for an unsecured credit care three months after I signed up for the card and that's when the representative told me that I was reponsible for the negative account and wouldn't be elgible for the unsecured credit card until it was paid. I told her that that couldn't be accurate because the {$3000.00} was made and if it wasn't how why did Navy federal allow me to utilize the XXXX and charge me interest on the money for several months if the account was not in good standing or if they never received the initial required payment for the card to be issued. I got the run around, I got I don't know, I got well when we went in to take the funds out of the checking/savings account the XXXX was there so that's why your account is in the negative, so I said well it must have been a computer error or the payment was actually applied to the account through the the system by ach transfer allowing the XXXX limit increase and she said no we never received the payment. I contact serveral associates including branch managers and also requested an investigations on where my XXXX XXXX dollars went if they didn't get the payment and all I got was a packet of bank states for a year but nothing showing that XXXX XXXX dollars was not applied to the credit card. I am writing this complaint because I get at least three calls a week from navy federal in regards to this credit card and every time I tell them why I am not paying they still cant resolved the issues and I am still responsible for interest rates, late payment ect.

VIN Number : XXXX To whom it may concern, I am aware that the FCRA allows for creditors to report but they have to be compliant and accurate at all times. My concern with this account is this. It is reported on my consumer report that this alleged debt was charged off. However, based on the notice of late payment required to be given to a consumer by the FCRA, I did not receive a late notice within five ( 5 ) business days nor was notified that XXXX XXXX XXXX will be putting a negative remark on my consumer report. 

Also, based on the Fair Credit Billing Act, XXXX XXXX XXXX failed to provide me an up to date balance during the month ( s ) that this alleged debt was reported as late so how am I able to make sure the balance was not modified or misrepresented during that time causing a calculated error and in turn, caused the account to be late? How do I know that surcharges were not billed by mistake and that you were accurate while reporting? Can you please provide me with these details.

Additionally, according to the IRS, a 1099-C was to be sent in accordance with this chargeoff as it is over XXXX However, one was not sent. Also, since the alleged debt was charged off, why are you still trying to collect on the alleged debt? Is that not considered fraud and abusive activity according to the FCRA? 



Again, according to the FCRA, all creditors MUST be compliant and accurate when reporting and I feel that XXXX XXXX XXXX failed in doing so.This account is inaccurate and XXXX XXXX XXXX had an obligation to the FCRA to tell me if I was going to be late and that you were going to post a negative remark on my consumer report. You also had an obligation to send me a 1099-C in which you failed to do so. With you reporting this account on my consumer report, it is considered an illegal report and in connection with the XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX will be in violation of certain codes equating to XXXX  per violation. 

Failure to respond satisfactorily with deletion of the above referenced account, and send out a free copy of my report after the changes have been made will result in legal actions being taken against your company, for which I will also be seeking XXXX per violation for : Defamation of Character ( per se ) Injury to person Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud Fair Debt Collections Practices Act 15 USC 1692g violations.

Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 USC 1681 violations for willful noncompliance - 616. Civil liability for willful noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681n ] This account is inaccurate and I am demanding that it be removed from my consumer report.

2023-02-07,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"","To All Concerned : I need to tell you how processs put in place actually fail for the person they are meant to protect. 
This is how Hurricane Mathew ( 2016 ) affected me. 
The failures I will to bring to light are that of Wells Fargo Mortgage ( WFM ), Wells Fargo Flood Zone Department ( WFF ) and Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ).

I will start with the failures of Wells Fargo as my mortgage company. I will quickly explain how they cheated me out my asset, a rental home, through unprofessional and unethical behavior and trickery.

The flood zone department of Wells Fargo refused to believe my house was in a flood zone. XXXX, I have no flood insurance. In 2016 Hurricane Matthew came through XXXX XXXX and destroys my house. Uninhabitable as eleven feet of water went through that property. 
My property is at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, North Carolina. I purchased the property in XXXX as a XXXX in the XXXX stationed at XXXX XXXX, NC. It was uniquely situated on the property and had a staircase of 30 steps leading from the top of the street down to the house. Because of that feature a flood zone examination request was done and it was shown at that time not to be in the flood zone. 
In XXXX, my insurance company ( XXXX ) notified me that flood zones had shifted and FEMA had new maps out. XXXX believed my home on XXXX XXXX was now in a flood zone. Although I had the house rented out, I should still carry the flood insurance. They informed me that I should be hearing from my mortgage company since it is a federal law to require me to have flood insurance while still paying on a mortgage. Although XXXX does not carry flood insurance, I could purchase it from FEMA. I contacted WFM and relayed what XXXX XXXX told me about needing flood insurance. WFM states they do not have information XXXXXXXX XXXX is in a flood zone and referred me to the WFF. WFF states that my home is NOT in a flood zone and I DO NOT need flood insurance. He added that XXXX was trying to sell me more insurance. 
Nine years later in XX/XX/XXXX, Hurricane Matthew comes thru XXXX XXXX and brings eleven feet of water through my little piece of property. The house that I had been renting out is now uninhabitable. I am very grateful the tenets had the sense to get out of there when the house, built five feet off the ground started taking in water. Inside the house took on six feet of water, everything ruined. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I called the Wells Fargo Mortgage Company, spoke with the flood department again about XXXX being in a flood zone. They maintained my property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NC was not in a flood zone. I told them my house was hit hard and flooded, the WFF point of contact still maintained that house was not in a flood zone.

I placed a formal compliant through Wells Fargo and asked for an investigation on the subject. They found that the WFF did maintain my house was not in a flood zone although it had been completely flooded. I had to speak with the flood zone guy to start any type of resolution and it took months. I called weekly for several months only to be met with stone- wall tactics of we dont know, we will get back with you, he is not here. Sometime in the spring of XXXX I was contacted by an attorney representing WFF. He said he would be my POC on the issue.

This attorney was only interested in protecting the WFF guy who said I did not need flood insurance. It took a couple of months for him to provide any type of offer. it takes months to arrive at any solution... it took months. Months of me calling weekly, all sorts of stall tactics used by Wells Fargo flood department. Did they think I would give up and go away? 

My insurance company valued that home at XXXX at that time. The first FEMA inspector that came thru valued it at fair market value of XXXX. Wells Fargo would not hear of it... they dont believe that those two assessments are credible and came up with a value of XXXX. They agreed to pay me XXXX if I turned around and paid off the XXXX I still owed. If I had an attorney, you can believe Wells Fargo would have to make this right FEMA- Wow, I can not think of a worst way to dole out taxpayer dollars to help folks out ... .untrained people that lack knowledge of any of the programs... i wont bore you with the nearly five years of being lead by the nose of better days are coming for you.. However, I will say this ; Please embed attorneys in FEMA that can help someone like me. If I could have made Wells Fargo step up and be accountable, I dont need tax payer dollars. FEMA did not ever ask if my mortgage company made me have flood insurance! Come to find out, the flood maps did change in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX was the only house on the street in the flood zone, but it was in the flood zone!

Why is the FEMA system not set up to help folks like me? How hard would that be to offer legal service. They had volunteer attorneys but they couldnt do anything for me. Why not?

That house was three years from being paid off. Then, the rent would supplement my retirement income. It was to allow for annual trips with the grandkids... it was worth keeping up and keeping rented, because of that income stream. Its gone... no hope of getting it back. Wells Fargo gets away with treating me like nothing and having my VERY hard earned money go down the drain. 
Not only do a only get a fraction of the value, and I was only asking for fair market value at XXXX, but I lost a very valuable to me, income stream for my retirement! 
Processes are broken. I hope the XXXX XXXX bans Wells Fargo to military personal.

Since the product was not delivered on time even after 20 days and as there was no communication from Walmart.com and the Seller XXXXXXXX XXXX  about delays and new updated delivery date, I cancelled the order. 
The seller agreed to refund me {$4300.00} keeping shipping expenses and thus Walmart.com refunded {$4300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to my PayPal Credit account ( Transaction ID : XXXX, screenshot attached ). 
I also thus never received the Television. 
I also promptly paid the balance of {$350.00} to my PayPal Credit account on XXXX XXXX, expecting a {$0.00} balance on my PayPal Credit account due to this transaction. 

I had also filed a dispute with PayPal Credit that the seller was wrong to deduct {$350.00} since they did not deliver the product when they promised even after many days ( more than 2 weeks ) and not communicated to me about the delivery new date. 

But for some reason, PayPal Credit returned the entire refunded amount of {$4300.00} to WALMART.COM and charged Re charged my account for the full {$4600.00}. 

I also made a balance payment of {$43.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX XXXX on my account. 

I have called PayPal Credit multiple times and their Customer Service representative noted the whole scenario and filed a dispute for me but no action has been taken by them. 

So now I am in a situation, where I dont have the Product and I have a Current balance on my PayPal Credit account. 

I have attached my original purchase and the refund transaction screenshot to my PayPal Credit account.

2023-01-04,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",International money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"Around XX/XX/2022 and on two separate occasions, I ( made significant financial transfers from my XXXX XXXX bank account using Crypto.com as the intermediary foreign exchange to accounts in my name listed within the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX web site at the time claimed that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was a trading platform for the purpose of buying and selling currencies. Within this platform, I initially held a trading account with the XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX. In Late XXXX ( about XX/XX/XXXX ), that account was transferred to a new account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Conducting XXXX  trading activities in both these accounts, I amassed some profits according to the information that they provided me but when I attempted to withdraw my large initial investment from the XXXX XXXX account, I ran into delays and bogus tax requirements that prevented me from withdrawing not only my "" profits '' ( if they were ever real ) but also my initial investment. In short, I never received the services that XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereafter XXXX ) offered on their web page and learned, after some internet research, concluded that I was the victim of a totally fraudulent investment scheme. When I challenged the actions of XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the bogus tax requirement that they levied before they would release my funds, I received no help. This caused me to conclude that I was the victim of a scam and that the profits I thought I had amassed were not real but rather, fabrications designed to get me and other like me to invest money in these XXXX based entities. I realized at that point that going. after the XXXX firms for redress was unlikely to yield further success, so I turned my attention to Crypto.com, the exchange agent that sent my funds to the XXXX XXXX XXXX account. As a dealer in international currencies, I felt that Crypto.com had a fiduciary responsibility to ensure, to the best of their ability, that funds were being transferred to legitimate entities in order to protect their customer 's interests ( there were fees associated with the crypto.com service ). I wrote a letter to Crypto.com that laid all this out and requested redress from crypto.com for failure to. protect my funds by ensuring that they went to a legitimate entity. In an email response, they denied all responsibility. 

Throughout this saga, my dealings with the XXXX agent who was offering me instruction and investing advice, I had no idea that I was potentially dealing with a fraudulent scheme until late XXXX. The agent instructing me in how to invest in currency using the XXXX XXXX XXXX and ( later ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX used my lack of knowledge and the processing of my payments through Crypto.com to create an air of overall legitimacy that, of course, proved not to be true. This was the first time I had any dealings with Crypto.com and cryptocurrency in general. I was manipulated and deceived for over a month, and I am confident that if I had suspected the scam during this time, I would have stopped the transactions. However, I was receiving constant lies and cleverly fabricated documentation from the scammers. I was told that Crypto.com as a currency exchange was a temporary payment processor, which after some research I believed because Crypto.com does provide payment services. However, I was saddened to learn ( after the fact ) that Crypto.com didnt perform any security checks to validate the legitimacy of entities to which their clients were sending funds. As a major player in the XXXX XXXX XXXX, Crypto.com either knew or should have known of fraudulent investing schemes such as this and had a responsibility to warn consumers of the general dangers involved or and the specific dangers in dealing with firms such as XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Instead, they simply took their frees and passed my funds along.",,"Foris DAX, Inc.",SC,29909,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2023-01-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6396905

2023-01-10,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"","RightPath Servicing has fraudulently assessed me for insurance. 
A letter sent to me dated XX/XX/XXXX, from RightPath Servicing, claimed my Home Owners insurance had expired, of which it did not. 
Proof of insurance was emailed, by me, to the email address listed in the letter stating, If you prefer you may update your HAZARD coverage information at XXXX. I emailed a copy of my hazard insurance on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 
A second letter was sent by RightPath Servicing, stating, This is your second and final notice to obtain insurance or provide RightPath Servicing proof of insurance, as our records show that your HAZARD insurance expired and we do not have evidence that you have obtained new coverage. Because HAZARD insurance is required on your property, we plan to buy insurance for your property. 
I emailed RightPath Servicing, again, on XX/XX/XXXX, providing them proof of HAZARD insurance coverage. 

I have acknowledged receiving letters from RightPath Servicing that were sent on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I have NEVER received a letter from RightPath Servicing dated XX/XX/XXXX, in fact, the first time I saw this letter was on XX/XX/XXXX when RightPath Servicing attached it to a response to my complaint filed on XX/XX/XXXX. RightPath Servicing had not provided this XXXX letter in response to previous complaints I had filed, including the complaint ( filed XX/XX/XXXX ) they responded to on XX/XX/XXXX, because its obvious that this letter did not exist before XX/XX/XXXX. 
The first time I became aware of RightPath Servicing assessing me for H06 insurance was in XXXX, as this was the first time my monthly mortgage payment statement reflected an assessment for FPI ( Forced Placed Insurance ). My XXXX mortgage payment statement amount was not changed to reflect the purchase of insurance ( H06 ) and neither was my XXXX mortgage statement. 
I immediately purchased XXXX insurance in XXXX, as this was the FIRST time it was brought to my attention that RightPath Servicing was requiring XXXX insurance AND NOT hazard insurance, as their letters of intent to purchase insurance on my behalf had consistently claimed HAZARD insurance. 

HAZARD INSURANCE, as defined by all major insurance providers is : HAZARD INSURANCE Nationwide Insurance What is hazard insurance? 
Hazard insurance generally refers to coverage for the structure of your home only. Other kinds of damage will be covered by other coverages within your homeowners insurance policy. Hazard insurance doesnt generally refer to the coverage that protects you for injuries incurred by you or your guests following an accident XXXX be covered by liability coverage. 
The reason hazard insurance is a common term is actually because of lenders. Your mortgage loan provider XXXX require hazard insurance at minimum before they will issue you a loan, because that is the only portion of the homeowners insurance policy directly related to the home structure itself. This XXXX create the misconception that hazard coverage can be purchased separately from homeowners insurance, which is not accurate. If your lender has specified that you need hazard or dwelling coverage, just know that generally purchasing a homeowners policy will satisfy their requirements. 

RightPath Servicing should now be investigated by the CFPB for their deliberate intent to fraud. The proof in their provided communications is irrefutable, they claimed I needed to purchase HAZARD INSURANCE and then placed a XXXX insurance policy on my property which, as its clear, is NOT hazard insurance. 

I am requesting an investigation into XXXX XXXX actions and to give strong consideration to their history of misconduct and millions paid in sanctions, under different entities.",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE LLC,FL,33458,,Consent provided,Web,2023-01-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6414793

I told them that I wanted to see the bill ( have not received it yet ), but to resolve this quickly because it went on my credit report, I paid it. 

It is quite disturbing that they would report me to the credit bureaus without trying to contact me at my correct address or call me about it. I learned from XXXX today that my score dropped XXXX points on account of this, as it falls into the very negative category of collections. I was about to apply for a personal loan and this impacts me financially quite severely. I checked with the two other credit bureaus and found similar effects.
