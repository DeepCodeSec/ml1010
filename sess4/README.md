Multi-Class Text Classification with Scikit-Learn [Github]

This article and Jupyter notebook solves a multi-class text classification problem with scikit-learn. It follows one iteration of the machine learning life cycle by: 1) formulating the problem, 2) exploring the data (include handling Imbalanced classes), 3) feature engineering (by representing the text and designing feature), 4) model selection and evaluation. Hopefully, it will give a overview of one iteration of the project without focusing too much on the different types of models.

After completing the programming code components, implement the methodologies you just learned into your project.
