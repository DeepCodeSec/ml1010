Online Session 5 - Coding Exercise
(The following links will open in new windows.)

Returning to the following code example from your In-Class tutorial (Github Code), you may use the normalized dataset that was given to you during In-Class Day 2 to skip the pre-process and fast forward to just training the deep learning model.

In addition, please follow through the Github code to gain practical hands-on experience by writing your own code. The exercise uses a Yelp dataset to build an LSTM neural network with word embedding for visualization, then a 1D convolution layer is added to reduce training time and, finally, the pre-trained GloVE word embedding was used as initial input. You may want to read the short THREE-part reading series explores text classification using LSTM, starting with Text Classification Using LSTM and visualize Word Embeddings: Part-1.

After completing the programming code components, think about which methodologies you would employ in your project and how you would use them.
